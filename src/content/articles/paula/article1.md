### Description of Key Components

- **public/**: Contains static files that will be served directly, such as images and the main HTML file.
  
- **src/**: The main source folder for the React application.
  - **assets/**: Store static assets like fonts and icons.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable components that can be used across different pages.
  - **pages/**: Contains the main pages of the blog, including a home page, individual teacher pages, an article page, and a 404 page.
  - **hooks/**: Custom React hooks for managing state or side effects.
  - **context/**: Context API files for managing global state.
  - **styles/**: Global styles, CSS modules, or styled-components for styling the application.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions that can be reused throughout the application.
  - **App.tsx**: The main application component that sets up routing and layout.
  - **index.tsx**: The entry point for the React application.

- **data/**: Contains JSON files with sample data for articles and teacher information, which can be fetched and displayed in the application.

### Design Considerations

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the layout is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Attractive UI**: Use a modern UI library (like Material-UI or Tailwind CSS) to create an attractive design.
- **User Experience**: Implement features like search, filtering articles by teacher, and easy navigation between articles.

### Next Steps

1. **Set Up the Project**: Initialize the project using Create React App or your preferred setup.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary libraries (e.g., React Router for navigation, Axios for data fetching).
3. **Create Components**: Start building out the components based on the proposed structure.
4. **Fetch Data**: Use the JSON files in the `data/` folder to populate the blog with articles and teacher information.
5. **Style the Application**: Apply styles to create an attractive and cohesive design.

This structure will help you maintain a clean and organized codebase as you develop your blog project for the two teachers.
