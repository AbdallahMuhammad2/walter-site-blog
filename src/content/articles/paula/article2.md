### Description of Key Folders and Files

- **public/**: Contains static files that will be served directly, such as images and the main HTML file.
- **src/**: The main source folder for the React application.
  - **assets/**: For static assets like fonts and icons.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable components that can be used throughout the application.
  - **pages/**: Contains the main pages of the blog, including the home page and individual teacher and article pages.
  - **layouts/**: Contains layout components that define the structure of the pages.
  - **hooks/**: Custom hooks for managing state and side effects.
  - **context/**: Context API files for managing global state.
  - **styles/**: Contains CSS files for styling the application.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions that can be reused across the application.
  - **App.tsx**: The main application component that sets up routing and context providers.
  - **index.tsx**: The entry point for the React application.
  - **routes.tsx**: Defines the routing for the application.
- **data/**: Contains JSON files with sample data for articles and teacher information.

### Design Considerations

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the layout is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
2. **Attractive UI**: Use a modern design framework like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for styling components to create an attractive user interface.
3. **User-Friendly Navigation**: Implement a clear navigation structure to allow users to easily find articles and information about each teacher.
4. **SEO Optimization**: Ensure that the blog is optimized for search engines by using proper meta tags and structured data.

### Next Steps

1. Set up the project using a tool like Create React App or Next.js.
2. Implement the directory structure as outlined above.
3. Create the necessary components and pages.
4. Populate the data files with sample articles and teacher information.
5. Style the components using CSS or a design framework.
6. Test the application for responsiveness and usability.

This structure will help you create a well-organized and maintainable blog project for the two teachers. Let me know if you need further assistance or specific code examples!
